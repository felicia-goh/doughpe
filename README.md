# Doughpe

Doughpe is web application written with the Ruby on Rails framework. It was designed for homebakers to list and sell their exclusive bakes at specific date/ time slots, as well as aggregate homebakers to allow buyers to browse easily.

The app is live at https://doughpe.herokuapp.com

## About

Doughpe was the first team project completed in 4 days as part of [Le Wagon](https://github.com/lewagon)'s Full Stack Web Development bootcamp (Batch #537, Singapore). The idea was pitched by Christian to automate the selling process for homebakers who often handle orders manually through personal messages on social media.
